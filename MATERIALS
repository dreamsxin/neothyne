Material files contain space-delimited key-value lines which represent a material.
The easiest material contains just a diffuse texture. More sophistopcated materials
are possible with the use of the appropriate key-value associations.

The following keys exist

* diffuse
    A diffuse texture

* normal
    A tangent space normal map texture. Tangent space normals assume 0.5 is a
    null component, 0.0 is a -1 component and 1.0 is a +1 component. Where
    RGB is XYZ respectively. The engine ignores the blue component since it can
    be derived from R and G.

* spec
    A local space specularity map. Local space specularity maps assume that the
    R component consists of the power term for specularity, while the G component
    consists of the intensity term.

* spec_power
    The following key cannot be used in conjuction with spec. This gives the entire
    material the following specular power for all pixels.

* spec_intensity
    The following key cannot be used in conjuction with spec. This gives the entire
    material the following specular intensity for all pixels.

* displacement
    A height map used for displacement mapping

* parallax
    Scale and bias used for displacement mapping. Bias is optional.
