# Neoythne

Neothyne is an attempt at getting back to the roots of good old twitch shooting
akin to that of Quake World.

## Philosphy

Neothyne is a game/engine with a focus on matching that of idTech3/Q3A in terms
of visual fidelity. At it's core Neothyne is a relatively simple engine with a
focus on providing a minimum set of features to make a twitch shooter.

## Status

As of late Neothyne is just a piece of tech which, while primitive in nature
embodies the following

* Efficent KD-tree (which allows for)
  * Efficent static and sweeping collision detection
  * Efficent scene management
* Forward renderer (which can do)
  * Directional lighting (with ambient and diffuse terms)
  * Specular lighting (with power and intensity terms)
  * Point lighting (with ambient, diffuse, and attenuation (exp, linear, constant))
  * Sky meshes (skybox, skydome, etc, any mesh will suffice).
  * Normal mapping (dot3 bump mapping)

## Goals

* Shadow mapping
* Spot lighting
* 3D Models
* Networking (client/server model)
* A game!
