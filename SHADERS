Shaders in Neothyne are written in GLSL with a bit of syntax sugar.

Neothyne will emit a prelude to each shader containing the version of GLSL to
utilize as well as things like HAS_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE if the GPU supports that
feature. You can find a list of the macros it emits by searching for
method::define in the code-base.

Neothyne supports the #include directive in GLSL; similarly, Neothyne will emit
uniform guards to prevent declaring uniforms more than once.

The following code:

    uniform vec2 foo;
    uniform vec4 bar;

Will be converted into:

    #ifndef uniform_foo
    uniform vec2 foo;
    #define uniform_foo
    #define line 1
    #endif
    #ifndef uniform_bar
    uniform vec4 bar;
    #define line 2
    #endif

This way you can have uniforms declared in headers which can be included without
causing conflicts.
