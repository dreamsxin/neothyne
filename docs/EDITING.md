Neothyne comes with a fairly straight forward editing mode for placing entities
in the world. The mode can be entered by pressing 'E'.

Inside edit mode you can click on any visible entity to edit its properties
through the edit menu. The edit menu can be toggled with 'F12'.

When there are no entities selected, by default the edit menu will contain
map specific options like ambient lighting. The default edit menu also allows
one to insert a new entity.

Moving entities can be accomplished by clicking and dragging the entity around
while flying.

You'll note entities like models and lights have a bounding box / sphere which
changes color when selected.

A selected entity can be deleted through the edit menu or with 'DEL'.

Map variables can be found in `VARS.md'
